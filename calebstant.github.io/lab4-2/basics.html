    <h1>Why I like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>
    <P> Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. 
        When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find me dipping 
        into my backyard pool. It's not an impressive pool, only three feet deep, 
        but it's mine.</P>
     <P>There are three reasons I like to swim: </P>
     <ul>
        <li> I get lots of exercise </li>
        <li> I enjoy the freedom</li>
        <li> I have the oppertunity to be in the sun.</li>
     </ul>

<p>Hi. My name is Muffins. I am a mighty
cat. I was adopted by my family when I was
only three weeks old.</p>
<p>My new mommy is a human. They are funny
creatures. </p>
<p>I left the pound with my new mommy and
new sister, Maria. They took me straight to
the pet store to buy:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
  <li>A small cloth toy</li>
  <li>Litter box with litter</li>
  <li>Food (for later)</li></ul>
  <p>Mom and sis had to feed me by bottle
because I was so young.</p>

    kittens, you can go to this link from the
